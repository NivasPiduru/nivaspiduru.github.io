Hi! I'm Nivas Piduru, a robotics graduate student at Arizona State University specializing in autonomous systems and intelligent machines. I'm driven by the challenge of making robots that don't just follow instructions—they understand, adapt, and make decisions in real-time.

## What I'm Working On

My work sits at the intersection of robotics, computer vision, and AI. I build systems where robots can see their environment, understand natural language commands, and execute complex tasks autonomously. Think voice-controlled robotic arms that can stack blocks intelligently, or autonomous vehicles that navigate and make split-second decisions.

Recent highlights include developing a voice-controlled manipulation system that combines OpenCV for vision, Google's Gemini LLM for natural language understanding, and ROS2 for seamless robot control—all working together to let robots respond to commands like "stack the red block on top of the blue one."

## What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking **Summer 2026 internships** in autonomous robotics, self-driving vehicles, or AI-powered systems. I bring:

- **Hands-on robotics experience**: ROS2, computer vision (OpenCV), and real-time control systems
- **AI/ML expertise**: Deep learning, NLP, and reinforcement learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow
- **System integration skills**: Combining hardware, software, and AI to solve real-world problems
- **Cross-disciplinary background**: Automobile engineering + data science + robotics

## My Journey

I started in automobile engineering at Velammal Engineering College in India, where I designed autonomous agricultural systems and competed in SAE India competitions. After gaining industry experience as a patent analyst in automation technologies, I pursued a PG Diploma in Data Analytics and Machine Learning. Now at ASU, I'm bringing all these experiences together to push the boundaries of what autonomous systems can do.

## Beyond the Lab

When I'm not training robots or debugging code, I share what I learn on my YouTube channel and stay curious about emerging technologies in AI and robotics.

## Let's Connect

Whether you're working on cutting-edge robotics, hiring for internships, or just want to talk about autonomous systems—I'd love to hear from you. Reach out via email or connect on LinkedIn!
